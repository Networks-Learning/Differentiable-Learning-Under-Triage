## Execution

Please refer to `train.ipynb` for implementation of our method as well as all the baselines. 

The `process_text_data.py` loads the `labeled_data.csv` file which contains the hatespeech tweets and generates the `hatespeech_data.pkl`. If you want to generate the data use the following command:  `python3 generate_text_data.py`
